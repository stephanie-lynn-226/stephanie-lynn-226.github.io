Elliptic Curves with all quadratic twists of positive rank

Definition: E/Q an elliptic curve.

L(E/Q,s) = \prod_{good p} \frac{1}{1-a_p p^{-s} + p^{1-2s}} \prod_{p bad} \frac{1}{1-a_p p^{-s}}

a_p = p+1 - #E(F_p), if E has good reduction
    = 1            , split multiplicative reduction
    = -1           , nonsplit multiplicative
    = 0            , p cuspidal

Reference: p. 360, Silverman's book AEC

[analogous definition over a number field]

\Lambda(E/Q,s) = N_{E/Q}^(s/2) (2\pi)^{-s} \Gamma(s) L(E/Q,s)

N_{E/Q} = conductor of the elliptic curve = \prod p^{f_p} 
f_p = 0 if p is good, 1 if p is nodal, 2 + \delta_p, p cuspidal,
\delta_p measures wild ramification

\Gamma(s) = \int_0^{\infty} t^{s-1} e^{-t} dt

extends meromorphically to all of C.

Let E/K an elliptic curve, F/K a quadratic extension

L(E/F,s) = L(E/K,s) L(E^F/K,s)

Conjecture (Hasse-Wweil): \Lambda(E/K,S) has an analytic continuation of all of C and satisfies

\Lambda(E/K,s) = w(E/K) \Lambda(E/K,2-s)

Thus the root number is +1 if the order of vanishing at s = 1 is even, -1 if the order of vanishing at s = 1 is odd.

Example: If the L-function does not vanish at s = 1, then the root number is equal to 1.  

Definition: E/K is Lawful if w(E/F) = 1 for every quadratic extension F/K.

Remark: E is lawful if for all quadratic twists F/K, w(E^F/K) = w(E/K).  

This follows from the elementary fact together with the conjectured analytic continuation.

Definition: w(E/K) = \prod_v w(E/K_v)

The local root number at every Archimedean place is -1.  

For all v,

w(E/K_v) := \epsilon(\sigma^1_{E,v},\psi,dx)/|\epsilon(\sigma^{1_{E,v},\psi,dx)|

\epsilon-factor of canonical representation of the Weil-Deligne group of K_v

\psi = unitary character of K_v

dx = Haar measure on K_v

Thm (Rohrlich 1996, p. 329)

K = Q

w(E/\R) = -1 

For a prime p, if E has multiplicative reduction at p, then 
w(E/Q_v) = \chi(-1), \chi is the character of Q associated to F(\sqrt{-c_6})/F

v_p(j(E)) < 0, then w(E/Q_v) = \chi(-1)

Definition: E is lawful good w(E/K) =  1
                 lawful evil w(E/K) = -1

Chaotic: not lawful.

BSD: Lawful evil: w(E/K) = w(E^F/K) = -1, then 

rk(E/F) = rk(E/K) + rk(E^F/K) > rk(E/K)

for all quadratic F/K!

Theorem 1: E/K an elliptic curve.  TFAE: \\
(i) E/K is lawful.
(ii) E/K_v is lawful for all places v.
(iii) w(E/F) = w(E/K)^{[F:K]} for all finite extensions F/K
(iv) K has no real places and E acquires everywhere good reduction over an 
abelian extension L of K.  
(v) K has no real places and for all primes p and all places v not dividing p 
f K, the action of G(\overline{K_v}/K_v) on T_p(E) is abelian.
